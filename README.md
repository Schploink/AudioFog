## Presenting: Audiofog

[AudioFog](https://audiofog.herokuapp.com/#/) is a project to clone the SoundCloud website with Ruby on Rails as the backend, React/Redux as the frontend, and postgreSQL as the database. The aim was to create a website with workable features similar to SoundCloud in user authentication, uploadable sounds, audio playback, the ability to leave comments, and general styling similarities.

## Features

### User Authentication

  * Users can create a secure account and login
  * A demo user is available to experience the website and features

### Sound uploading and playback

  * Users can create/upload, edit, or delete/destroy sounds
  * Sounds are able to playback through a playback bar regardless of where they are on the site
  * The playback bar will allow for tracking when clicked on the playbar or on the player in the show page for the sound
  * A volume control for the playback bar

### Sound and User show page

  * A show page for each unique user and sound
  * Ability for users to leave comments on uploaded sounds
